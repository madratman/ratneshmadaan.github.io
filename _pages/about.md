I am working as a Research Engineer with the [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim/) team.    

Before that, I was a Masters in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University, working on perception and motion planning algorithms for quadrotors at the [Air Lab](theairlab.org) at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu), advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/) and working closely with [Michael Kaess](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~kaess/). 
I focused on thin obstacle detection and mapping for UAVs, and marrying traditional sampling based motion planning algorithms with machine learning. 

### (Not Fake) News 
- 2019-12: I helped organize [Game of Drones, a drone racing competition at NeurIPS 2019](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing/index.html) built on AirSim.
Read our [MSR blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/game-of-drones-at-neurips-2019-simulation-based-drone-racing-competition-built-on-airsim/?OCID=msr_blog_gameofdrones_neurips_fb) for a quick overview. 
- 2019-09: Check out our [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06993) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSugOL0qI44&feature=youtu.be) on learning cross-modal representations for imitation learning, applied to the drone racing problem. Work done with our summer research intern, Rogerio Bonatti. 
- 2019-01: Our paper ["Multi-view Reconstruction of Wires using a Catenary Model"](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/multi-view-reconstruction-of-wires-using-a-catenary-model-2/), Ratnesh Madaan, Michael Kaess, Sebastian Scherer. was accepted at ICRA 2019!
- 2018-11: Moved to Seattle and started working at Microsoft. The days were even shorter than Pittsburgh, but there is no snow. Pittsburgh robotics vibe is unmatched, but the Pacific Northwest has its own charm to it. 
- 2018-10: Our paper, [Learning Adaptive Sampling Distributions for Motion Planning by Self-Imitation](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/workshops/mlmp2018/assets/docs/20_CameraReadySubmission_learn2sample_iros_extended_abstract_compressed.pdf) was accepted to the [Machine Learning in Robot Motion Planning workshop](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/workshops/mlmp2018/) in IROS 2018. 
- 2018-08: Defended my Masters Thesis, "Wire Detection, Reconstruction, and Avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", spanning semantic segmentation using synthetic data generation and dilated convolutional networks, model-based multiview reconstruction, model-free grid mapping, and trajectory library based avoidance. For more details, here is the [defense video](https://youtu.be/hcBduruWLp8), [thesis slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U0Kb8G4NeIRWEB-_JExFZJwF_xmySf0iUt6d9S42jQ4/edit?usp=sharing), and the [PDF](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/wire-detection-reconstruction-andavoidance-for-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/). 
- 2018-06: Our paper, [DROAN - Disparity-space Representation for Obstacle AvoidaNce : Enabling Wire Mapping & Avoidance](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/droan-disparity-space-representation-for-obstacle-avoidance-enabling-wire-mapping-avoidance/) was accepted to IROS 2018. 
- 2017-07: Our paper, [Wire Detection using Synthetic Data and Dilated Convolutional Networks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/wire-detection-using-synthetic-data-and-dilated-convolutional-networks-for-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/) was selected as a finalist for the **[Best Application Paper award at IROS 2017](https://www.iros2017.org/program/award-winners).
- 2017-07: Our paper, [Deep Flight: Learning Reactive Policies for Quadrotor Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ratneshmadaan.github.io/files/deep_flight.pdf) appeared in the  Workshop on Learning Perception and Control for Autonomous Flight at RSS 2017. 
- 2016-08: Started Masters in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh. 
- 2016-05: Finished RA-ship at the [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/), RI, CMU. I was an RA from 2015-09 to 2015-11, and then from 2016-02 to 2016-05.
- 2015-08: Finised the best summer internship at the Manipulation Lab, RI, CMU as part of the 2015 [RI Summer Scholars](riss.ri.cmu.edu) cohort. I worked on Predicting orientation under manipulation actions using Bingham distributions. See [report](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Journal-RISS2015.pdf#page=75) and [poster](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ratnesh_Madaan_RISS_poster.pdf). 
- 2015-05: Finished undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. After 2 weeks, flew to Pittsburgh to begin a new life. 
<!-- Apart from that, I've worked on a few [projects](https://ratneshmadaan.github.io/projects/).  -->

<!-- Prior to this, I worked as an Research Associate I in the Air Lab for a cumulative of 6 months in 2015-2016.
Before that, in summer 2015, I was a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar in the Manipulation Lab, under Erol Sahin and Robbie Paolini, on predicting the outcome of manipulative actions, before intuitive physics became mainstream. 
 --><!-- I also have worked as a Google Summer of Code student with ROS-Industrial, on writing a library which utilizes OMPL for free space planning and the Descartes library for planning in constrained spaces.  -->
<!-- I graduated with a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in 2015.  -->

<!-- During times when I am tired of being a wannabe in robotics, I tend to come back to old hobbies or try to pick up some new ones. 
These include [biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4053560), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408058-ratnesh-madaan) (totally not adding books to my to-read list), playing the guitar and piano, [sketching](http://madratman.deviantart.com/gallery), and [writing](https://madratman.quora.com).
