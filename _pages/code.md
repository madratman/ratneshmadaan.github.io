List of repos, apart from those linked in publications and project pages.    
Note: A lot of links are now placeholders until I do the final cleanups and licensing. 

- [DQN for Atari](https://github.com/madratman/deeprl_hw2_src), Python+Tensorflow<br/>
Cool homework assignment for [10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control](https://katefvision.github.io/), Spring 2017. 
Checkout [videos of our DQN playing Space Invaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ2TG76iQ0U&feature=youtu.be) and [report](https://ratneshmadaan.github.io/files/dqn_atari_hw_report.pdf)

- [sampling_based_planners](https://github.com/madratman/sampling_based_planners), C++<br/>
RRT, RRT\*, RRT-Connect, PRM for a 5 DoF planar arm, as part of a cool homework assignment for [16-782 Planning and Decision-making in Robotics](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/classes/robotplanning_grad/), Fall 2017. 

- [uav_waypt_planner_ompl](), C++<br/>
<!-- - [uav_waypt_planner_ompl](https://github.com/ratneshmadaan/uav_waypt_planner_ompl), C++<br/> -->
Simple waypoint planner using OMPL for XYZ, XYZYaw, and DubinsZ state space. 

- [sem_seg_tx2_benchmarking](), Python<br/>
<!-- - [sem_seg_tx2_benchmarking](https://github.com/ratneshmadaan/sem_seg_tx2_benchmarking), Python<br/> -->
Some benchmarking scripts for various libraries(theano, caffe2, pytorch, lasagne) I wrote to check what works best on TX-2. 

- [traj_lib_gen_richter_bry](https://github.com/ratneshmadaan/traj_lib_gen_richter_bry), MATLAB<br/>
Partial implementation of [Polynomial trajectory planning for aggressive quadrotor flight in dense indoor environments](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-28872-7_37) by Charles Richter, Adam Bry, Nicholas Roy in MATLAB. 

- [visual_servoing_guidance_ros](), C++<br/>
<!-- - [visual_servoing_guidance_ros](https://github.com/madratman/visual_servoing_guidance_ros), C++<br/> -->
Visual servoing of a power line for a DJI M100 with a camera mounted on top. The end goal is complicated, so ask me if you're wondering why the heck we did this.  
Check [flashy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hpSSbL3lYI) of demo, and the not so [flashy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wie7HQW1x8) as well. 

- [lightware_sf40c_ros_driver](), C++<br/>
<!-- - [lightware_sf40c_ros_driver](https://github.com/madratman/lightware_sf40c_ros_driver), C++<br/> -->
A ROS wrapper I wrote for the driver of [Lightware SF-40/C](http://www.lightware.co.za/shop/en/products/45-sf40c-100-m.html) laser scanner. 

- [Implementation of pulse coupled neural networks](https://github.com/madratman/pcnn_simple), C++<br/>
Implementation of [Towards automatic power line detection for a UAV surveillance system using pulse coupled neural filter and an improved Hough transform](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00138-009-0206-y)

- Fields Robotics Center, RI's Cluster<br/>
I made these [tutorial slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14bh9Za6IICLtdIvOABGfegyhjntxrdDrhouFf-usPx0/edit?usp=sharing) and wrote most of our [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/castacks/cluster/wiki/Home). 

- [wires_class_activation_mapping](), Python<br/>
<!-- - [wires_class_activation_mapping](https://github.com/ratneshmadaan/wires_class_activation_mapping), Python<br/> -->
Experiments with Class Activation Mapping (http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/) with an unlabeled dataset of images with wires (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n6wrv4ry6v/6)

- [rosbag_utils](https://github.com/madratman/rosbag_utils), Python<br/>
Bunch of utility scripts I use to process rosbags. Some are borrowed & modified with credits

- [py_video_editor](https://github.com/madratman/py_video_editor), Python<br/>
A couple of video editing scripts using opencv and python, coz editing in a cafe while sipping Mocha with a Mac is too mainstream

<!-- - [attention_gan](https://github.com/madratman/attention_gan), Python<br/>  -->
Hacky implementation of a wild idea that didn't see light of the day.
