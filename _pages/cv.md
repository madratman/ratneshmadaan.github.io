I am a Masters in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University, working on perception and motion planning algorithms for quadrotors at the [Air Lab](theairlab.org) at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu), advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/) and working closely with [Michael Kaess](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~kaess/). 
Current focuses of my research are thin obstacle detection and mapping for UAVs, and marrying traditional sampling based motion planning algorithms with machine learning. 

Prior to this, I worked as an Research Associate I in the Air Lab for a cumulative of 6 months in 2015-2016. 
Before that, in summer 2015, I was a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar in the Manipulation Lab. I worked on predicting the outcome of manipulative actions with Prof. Erol Sahin and Robbie Paolini, before intuitive physics became mainstream. 
I also have worked as a Google Summer of Code student with ROS-Industrial, on writing a library which utilizes OMPL for free space planning and the Descartes library for planning in constrained spaces. 
I graduated with a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in 2015. 

During times when I am tired of being a wannabe in robotics, I tend to come back to old hobbies or try to pick up some new ones. 
These include [biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4053560), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408058-ratnesh-madaan) (totally not adding books to my to-read list), playing the guitar and piano, [sketching](http://madratman.deviantart.com/gallery), and writing.
